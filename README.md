## Purpose
 ### Background
 The Financial Aid team (Steve Winey, Tim Entner, Christie Bitner) is concerned that the 2024-25 FAFSA delay could prevent graduate summer header students from accessing federal aid. Since some students rely on federal loans to pay for living expenses, a delay in aid could lead to a financial crisis.\n
 To prevent this, the Financial Aid team would like to allow certain students to increase their loans for this current semester to cover summer living expenses. Students for consideration are those who have “accepted” federal aid for this current semester and have room to borrow additional funds.\n
 ### Data collection
 Tim and Steve used PUTTY to gather initial data. The first report listed all de-identified graduate students and their active program, and the second report listed de-identified graduate students who completed a FAFSA and “accepted” federal loans. These were saved as two spreadsheets.
 ### The problem
 The team asked Jonathan Bitner to help:
 1. Remove unnecessary letters at the end of each graduate program abbreviation (for example: change MSN.NSG to MSN)
 2. Merge the two spreadsheets together as Table 1
 3. Split up the Unsub and PLUS loans from one column into two columns (for example: Student6008 accepted $33,000 in Unsub loans and $0 in PLUS loans) as Table 2
